People asked why 7 slots in the voice channels. That is because you can fit a whole stack of 6 in there, and leave an open slot for somebody to hop in and check on things. I personally would not want to be in a 6 stack and have a separate 3 stack playing competitive out of the same voice.
Last thing for the day, don't get toxic with your own team, nobody likes that. Tilt the enemy as much as you want, I love to play against a tilted team, it helps with the win. Just remember that if you tilt your team, then you are helping the other team win (aka helping you lose).

This may be a revelation to some, but keep in mind that you are in no way required to play with everyone in the server. Let's say for example people want to 6 stack but we only have 6 healers on, you don't have to do that.

You can now self identify using the Dyno bot! All you need to do is write "?rank Ana" for example to add Ana to your list of heroes. if Ana is already in the list, then doing this will remove her. The hero names all start with an upper case, and D. Va is "DVa" for the sake of the program. PLEASE USE THE #classes CHANNEL FOR ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE "?rank" COMMAND.(edited)
I forgot to mention, you can also self identify your role for DPS, Tank, Heals, and Flex using the same command

The Just Chillin and Opposite of Chillin is Fire channels are just for hanging out there is no limit to the number of people in these channels. The Come Here for InHouse Prep channel is where we will meet before every inhouse to make sure everything is squared away; no limit to the number of members (myself or whatever admin is running that inhouse may mute everyone just for noise sake during setup). Professional Games will be our designated channel for anyone who is watching a game on Twitch or other platforms, for people to discuss the game if they wish; no limit. The next four channels are our current competitive channels, use these for any group needs you may have; these are limited to 7 people for clutter sake (6 man group plus open slot for 1 person to jump in and out). The Admin Channel will be used by admins whenever they need to discuss events, rules, etc.; we will avoid grouping in this channel (but we may forget, we are in fact human, shocking). Occasionally you may see 8/7 or 9/7 in the competitive channels and that is due to the admin power, discord admin can do pretty much anything when it comes to the server.(edited)

Hello! Welcome to the Proverwatch community! First thing's first, change your nickname on this server to your in-game battletag, don't worry about the numbers. Please list multiple accounts using a "/" so that poeple will know who you are. Second thing, self identify your in game role from the categories of DPS, Tank, Heals, and Flex using the "?rank" command.  An example is "?rank DPS" would add you to DPS. Choose one, and be honest with yourself. Don't list DPS if your best three are tanks but you like to play Genji. I love to play Widow, but I am bad. These self proclaimed roles will help when forming teams. PLEASE USE THE #classes CHANNEL FOR ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE "?rank" COMMAND.
Disclaimer: your listed role is not necessarily binding, it is just your most used. If 2/3 times you are a healer, then you will be listed as a healer. You can figure out with your teammates whether you should switch off to a tank/dps/whatever. The flex is for people who generally "fill" and can fill well.
You can also add heroes to your profile using the same "?rank" command. Hero names all start with an upper case, and D. Va is listed as "DVa" for the sake of the program. I ask that people choose a maximum of 4 heroes, but it is not required to have any heroes listed. We ask that anyone choosing Flex add heroes to their profile. PLEASE USE THE #classes CHANNEL FOR ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE "?rank" COMMAND.
You can @ any class and any character to draw attention to it, or if you want to know yourself, you can see the class list on the right hand side of the discord. The character lists are found by the following command "?tag [Hero]". For example "?tag Reinhardt"
If you do not set a role (flex, heals, tank, or DPS) within a week of being invited to the server, you will be kicked and will need to be reinvited. Please help us stay organized! Thank you!

# Purpose

Proverwatch is a Discord LFG community (Looking For Group) for serious players building competitive groups.

Proverwatch was started to battle the ravages of random queueing: the bad comps, bot teammates, and rampant tilt that makes solo queueing such a chore.

We're a group of players who are serious about competitive play. Some of us just want to rank up, others want to play in organized tournaments, and everyone cares about gameplay, teamplay, and improvement.

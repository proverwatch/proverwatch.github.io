# Inhouse Tournament

Welcome to Proverwatch’s first official inhouse tournament, we are excited to see how the teams perform in the coming weeks! Below outlines the rules and regulations regarding this inhouse; once published to the website, these are set in stone until the completion of the tournament. Any feedback you may have can be directed to spot92 AFTER the tournament for future use. This is coinciding roughly with Proverwatch’s 6 month anniversary, so this is a celebration on top of a competition. This community is here because of you guys, thanks for all your participation and good luck out there!

**Date:** August 11 start. Tournament will take place over multiple days.

## Referees
- Spot92
- Bollweevil
- Holiest

This committee will oversee the event and resolve any disputes that may arise based upon a simple vote, majority wins. None are anticipated, but any rules questions that are not addressed in the final version of the rules will also be resolved here. Along with resolving disputes, this committee will oversee streaming and casting the games. The committee will not be members on any teams to maintain objectivity.

## Team Creation

- Teams will consist of a core group of 4 that is self-determined with the remaining two being added by the referee committee from the pool of players that register as free agents. This is for multiple reasons.
- - This is designed to increase the number teams playing in the tournament.
- - This will encourage Proverwatch members to sign up for the tournament even if they do not know enough people to form a 6 stack.
- Registration is open as soon as this has been published.
- Members will submit to the Referee Committee their 4 man team or free agent status no later than July 18. Any submissions after this date will not be considered.
- The committee will announce final teams on July 21.
- Each team will have exactly one captain to communicate with the committee and each other as necessary.
- All members of a team must be members of Proverwatch by July 11. No exceptions.
- All members are required to have completed their season 5 placement matches by the first day of competition. Any team with a failure to do so will forfeit.

## Teams
- A team name is required.
- Submit to spot92 an image that you would like to represent your team, you will be getting a custom discord emote.
- Each team is recommended to begin their own group DM on discord to communicate roles, strategies, strengths, weaknesses, etc.
- As 4 man groups register, they will be publicly announced.
- 
## Bracket
- The teams will be organized based on the average of group current SR and season high SR, with a higher SR meaning a higher seed. This will be based on season 5 stats for the accounts listed in team registration. No alt account considerations.
- SR data will be taken on July 22.
- Ultimately the bracket size and organization depends on the number of teams that register, so the final bracket will be determined by the Referee Committee.
- All non-final matches will be BO3.
- The final will be BO5.

The committee reserves the right to change the competition format in order to accommodate more or less teams. Any changes will be announced within a week of competition start and communicated to the team captains. The team captains are in charge of communicating changes to their teams.

## Matches
- Match times will be coordinated between the competing team captains and the committee.
- Every match will start on a King of the Hill map.
- Each round of the bracket will start on the same King of the Hill. For example, the semi-final matches may all start on Oasis while the final match starts on Nepal.
- The King of the Hill map will be determined by the committee and communicated to the team captains.
- After each map, the loser will be able to choose the next map based on the following:
- - The map can not be a King of the Hill.
- - The map must be a different type compared to the most recent map. For example, a team can not choose Anubis after immediately playing Volskaya.
- The winner of the previous map will be able to choose the side they want first, attack or defense.
- Between all maps, there will be a 3 minute break.
- In the event of ties, all ties will be played out on the previous round’s King of the Hill map. For example, a tie in the finals will be played out on the semi-final’s King of the Hill map.
- All maps will be competitive ruleset except for ties. Ties will be played out on quick play King of the Hill rules.

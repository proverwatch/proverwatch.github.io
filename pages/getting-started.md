# getting started

Proverwatch has a few guidelines to streamline the LFG and team building process:

- Declare your [roles](pages/roles.md)
- Set your Proverwatch username to your Battle.net tag so that people know who they're talking to in group
- Check out the [inhouse games](pages/inhouse.md)
- If you want access to the #feedback channel where Proverwatch members give each other advice/do VOD reviews ask an @Admin
- Use the [#lfg](pages/looking-for-group.md) channel and play some games!

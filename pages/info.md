```

## Recruiting
Recruitment is open. If you meet good natured (low ego, low toxicity, stays off tilt) skillful folks out there in the random queues feel free to invite them (in Discord: Click "Proverwatch" and select "Invite People"). *Note* As Proverwatch grows invites may occasionally be closed. If so PM an admin (folks with faded red names) for an invite.

## Voice Channels

People asked why 7 slots in the voice channels. That is because you can fit a whole stack of 6 in there, and leave an open slot for somebody to hop in and check on things.

## Toxicity Policy ("Code of Conduct"? "Attitude"?)
Last thing for the day, don't get toxic with your own team, nobody likes that. Tilt the enemy as much as you want, I love to play against a tilted team, it helps with the win. Just remember that if you tilt your team, then you are helping the other team win (aka helping you lose).

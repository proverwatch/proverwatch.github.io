# Inhouse Games

Proverwatch holds regular inhouse scrims for fun and team building. Players sign up and are either drafted by captains or split up according to ***the power of math***. Inhouse games are recorded, videos uploaded to #videos, and VOD review happens in #feedback.

**When:** Inhouse games happen every Friday at 9PM Pacific Time.

**Sign up** for the current inhouse games by placing `X` in the #inhouse channel. (The channel is wiped every week, so keep discussion to #lobby and #feedback)

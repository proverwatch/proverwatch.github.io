# looking for group

Proverwatch is a looking for group (LFG) server. When looking for a group use the following to maximize your gameplay.

- Be specific: if you're solo mention the roles you main and your desired group SR
- Use the @roles to notify people. If you're in a 5stack and need another tank call for an @Tank in the #lfg channel
- Use care in group games: establish preferred comps ahead of time. Communicate and stay positive.

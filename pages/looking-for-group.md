# looking for group

Proverwatch is a looking for group (LFG) server. When looking for a group use the following to maximize your gameplay.

- Be specific: if you're solo mention the roles you main and your desired group SR
```
drags> solo DPS | looking for 3stack | around 3000 SR
```
- Use the @roles mentions to notify people. If you're in a 5-stack and need another tank:
```
Kayleesi> @Tank | 5stack | looking for an off tank | 2950 group SR
```
- Use care in group games: establish your teams preferred comps ahead of time. Communicate and stay positive.

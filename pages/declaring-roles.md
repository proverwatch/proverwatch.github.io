# Declaring Roles

"role" and your top **3** heroes by joining the #classes channel and using the `?rank` command.
  - The 4 "roles" are `DPS`, `Tank`, `Heals`, and `Flex`.
  - Example: `?rank DPS` to declare as a DPS main
  - Hero ranks start with an uppercase letter. "D.Va" also becomes "DVa"
  - Example: `?rank Soldier76`, `?rank Reinhardt`
- You're not required to play only these roles/heroes, but it helps in the LFG process to declare strongest roles.

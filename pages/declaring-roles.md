# Declaring Roles

Declare the roles that you intend to play to help in the LFG and team building process.

Your roles are not set in stone and can be changed at any time, just be honest about your abilities. If you're a 3300 genji but only a 2700 hog don't jump into a masters 6 stack in the off-tank role.

**Note:** Do all role management in the `#classes` channel. Also, mute the `#classes` channel unless you like to be fooled by the unread icon in your Discord app.

#### Roles
There are currently 4 roles: `DPS, Tank, Heals,` and `Flex`. These are considered "main" roles, and you should only declare **one**.

Declare your "main" role with the `?rank` command (ex: `?rank Tank`). Setting your role allows for quick #lfg callouts like:
```
spot92> Looking for one @DPS
```

#### Heroes
Declare your top 3 heroes (max 3). They don't all have to be in your "role", but *at least* one should be.

Hero role names start with an uppercase letter (like `Tracer`), and there are no spaces (like `Soldier76`). D.Va is `DVa`

# feedback

Proverwatch is a community focused on improvement. One method of improvement is peer feedback on gameplay.

The `#feedback` channel is used for peer feedback and VOD review, however **not all players seek feedback**. As such, the #feedback channel is only available to the players who request access from an @admin, and **only the members of the channel should be given feedback**

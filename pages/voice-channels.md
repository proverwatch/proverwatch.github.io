# Voice Channels

Proverwatch has a number of voice channels:

- **Just Chillin** & **Opposite of Chillin is Fire**: These are unlimited channels meant for hanging out.
- **Professional Games**: For watching pro play as a group. When APEX finals roll around you'll find these channels full at ridiculous hours of the night.
- **Come Here for InHouse Prep**: This channel is where we hang out before in-house games. Only mods + team captains can talk here.
- ***4 channels with no set names***: These channels are the group channels. They are limited to 7 people to accommodate a full stack + one incomer/spec/coach. (Suggest naming themes to @admin)
- **The Dragon's Den**: Don't fuck with the dragons.
